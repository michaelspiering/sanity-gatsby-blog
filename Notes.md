## Notes

-- 4/27/22 --
* When I first try to build the website, there is an error.
* It looks like the error on the build server is different from the one I see locally.

-- 4/28/22 --
* There are an overwhelming number of exceptions and build errors.

-- 4/29/22 --
* After starting over, I had to remove the post that was causing the exception to get the thing to build.
* I broke the build.  You have to run npm install from the studio directory in order to update the package-lock.json file before pushing to main.
* The graphql chapter didn't require any code changes. Deployed from the cli.
